# FixRGL
A combination of PowerShell and Batch scripts that aim to fix most of the issues related to the Rockstar Games Launcher effectively.

Before running any PowerShell scripts, make sure that your ExecutionPolicy is set to Unrestricted, otherwise the scripts will not launch and or crash on startup.
Start by running a PowerShell window as administrator using Win + X or Windows Search or type `powershell` in the Run box using Win + R then press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**


You can use `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` then press the corresponding button for **Yes to All** and do `Get-ExecutionPolicy` to see if the change was successful.

Make sure that you accept any UAC administrator alerts for the scripts to run.
